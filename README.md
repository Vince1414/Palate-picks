Problems solved with this application

1.	Disorganized Recipe Collection: Many people have handwritten or digital recipes scattered across different platforms, making it challenging to find a specific recipe when needed. The web application provides a centralized and organized platform to store and access recipes.

2.	Forgetting Recipes: People often forget the details of a recipe they tried in the past. The app enables users to save their successful recipes along with cooking instructions, ensuring they can recreate their favourite dishes accurately.

3.	Sharing Recipes: When someone wants to share a recipe with friends or family, they might resort to sending screenshots or typing out instructions. The app provides an easy way to share recipes digitally, complete with ingredients, preparation steps, and images.

4.	Lack of Dietary Options: Individuals with specific dietary preferences (vegan, gluten-free, etc.) often struggle to find suitable recipes. The app can include filtering options that cater to various dietary needs, making recipe discovery easier.

5.	Meal Diversity: People might find themselves cooking the same few dishes repeatedly due to lack of inspiration. The app offers a diverse collection of recipes, encouraging users to try new dishes and expand their culinary repertoire.

6.	Misplaced or Lost Recipes: Paper recipes can be lost, damaged, or misplaced over time. A digital recipe book ensures that recipes are securely stored and accessible whenever needed.
